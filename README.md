# IPL-Score-Predictions
This Project helps us in predicting scores of IPL Matches at particular venue

This was a project I made for my Alumni Mentorship Program in Data Science

This is a very basic project which uses Linear Regressions for predicting the toal score of the team batting first in an IPL mathc.
It considers factors like Runs scored (till current situation, minimum 6 overs should be bowled), Wicktes lost, Runs scored in last 5 overs and Wickets lost in last 5 overs.
